# SI 699 final project interactive demo, created in Framer
**VISAPAL Demo Documentation:**
The interactive demo is meant to highlight the two main features and functionality of the tool. These main features are:

* Folder Structure (organize documents, upload documents to one place, dynamic checklist of documents) 
* Timeline Management (reminders, tasks (To Do lists), due dates)

Main functionality is built out for parts of each of these features, but is not entirely function. For example, documents available for interaction in the folder structure are the passport document view and the USCIS I-864 Form. These provide examples of the functionality that the other folders will have. 

**Login:**
The demo will allow the user to walk through the login process (create account process is omitted in the demo), and to navigate through the main functionality of the page. 

**Folder Structure:** 
This includes the folder structure, the user can interact with two of the four folders:
 I-130: Petition - completed folder
 DS160: Consulate - missing documents

The user can view a subfolder within the competed folder (passports) and a subfolder in the incomplete folder (DS160). Within the DS160 folder, in the USCIS Form I-864, the user can “upload” a document into the folder. The document upload is simulated because I could not build out the functionality of a document upload in this time frame and with my technical constraints. 

**Timeline Management:**
The use can also walk through the timeline functionality and see the overall timeline, and interact with pieces like setting a reminder (simulated) and setting due dates (simulated). Due to time constraints I chose only to make these functions available in the demo since the task list and other project management features are very similar.
